Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synthesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored.","[Papadopoulos, Irena; Lazzarino, Runa; Miah, Syed; Koulouglioti, Christina] Middlesex Univ, Sch Hlth & Educ, Dept Mental Hlth & Social Work, Res Ctr Transcultural Studies Hlth, London NW4 4BT, England; [Weaver, Tim; Thomas, Bernadette] Middlesex Univ, Sch Hlth & Educ, Dept Mental Hlth & Social Work, London, England","Papadopoulos, I (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ, Sch Hlth & Educ, Dept Mental Hlth & Social Work, Res Ctr Transcultural Studies Hlth, London NW4 4BT, England.",r.papadopoulos@mdx.ac.uk; r.lazzarino@mdx.ac.uk; s.miah@mdx.ac.uk; t.weaver@mdx.ac.uk; b.thomas@mdx.ac.uk; c.koulouglioti@mdx.ac.uk,,,,,"Ahmad MI, 2017, INT J HUM-COMPUT INT, V33, P943, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2017.1300750; Alemi M, 2015, INT J SOC ROBOT, V7, P523, DOI 10.1007/s12369-015-0286-y; Alemi M, 2014, INT J HUM ROBOT, V11, DOI 10.1142/S0219843614500224; Alimisis D., 2013, SCI TECHNOLOGY ED, V61, P63; [Anonymous], 2018, REUTERS; Aoun J.

A major factor driving this phenomenon is the proliferation of large networks of poorly secured IoT devices. This is exacerbated by the commoditization of the malware development industry, in which tools can be readily obtained in specialized hacking forums or underground markets. However, despite the great interest in targeting this infrastructure, there is little understanding of what the main features of this type of malware are, or the motives of the criminals behind it, apart from the classic denial of service attacks. This is vital to modern malware forensics, where analyses are required to measure the trustworthiness of files collected at large during an investigation, but also to confront challenges posed by tech-savvy criminals (e.g., Trojan Horse Defense). In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of Linux-based malware. Our study is tailored to IoT malware and it leverages automated techniques using both static and dynamic analysis to classify malware into related threats. By looking at the most representative dataset of Linux-based malware collected by the community to date, we are able to show that our system can accurately characterize known threats. As a key novelty, we use our system to investigate a number of threats unknown to the community. We do this in two steps. First, we identify known patterns within an unlabeled dataset using a classifier trained with the labeled dataset. Second, we combine our features with a custom distance function to discover new threats by clustering together similar samples. We further study each of the unknown clusters by using state-of-the-art reverse engineering and forensic techniques and our expertise as malware analysts. We provide an in-depth analysis of what the most recent unknown trends are through a number of case studies. Among other findings, we observe that: i) crypto-mining malware is permeating the IoT infrastructure, ii) the level of sophistication is increasing, and iii) there is a rapid proliferation of new variants with minimal investment in infrastructure.

Methods: We conducted an e-survey using a cloud-based website to gauge the potential sources of trustworthy information and misinformation and analyzed researchers', clinicians', and academics' attitude toward unpublished items, and pre- and post-publication quality checks in this challenging time. Results: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%) and 86 [67.2%)). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions. Most (74.2%) supported the need to launch a specialist bibliographic database for COVID-19, with information indexed (62.3%), available as open-access (82.8%), after expanding search terms (52.3%) and following due verification by academics (66.4%), and journal editors (52.3%). Conclusion: While identifying social media as a potential source of misinformation on COVID-19, and a perceived high risk of plagiarism, more stringent peer review and skilled post-publication promotion are advisable. Journal editors should play a more active role in streamlining publication and promotion of trustworthy information on COVID-19.","[Gupta, Latika; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas] Sanjay Gandhi Postgrad Inst Med Sci, Dept Clin Immunol & Rheumatol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gasparyan, Armen Yuri] Dudley Grp NHS Fdn Trust, Russells Hall Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Pensnett Rd, Dudley DY1 2HQ, W Midlands, England; [Gasparyan, Armen Yuri] Dudley Grp NHS Fdn Trust, Russells Hall Hosp, Dept Res & Dev, Pensnett Rd, Dudley DY1 2HQ, W Midlands, England; [Gasparyan, Armen Yuri] Univ Birmingham, Teaching Trust, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Zimba, Otena] Danylo Halytsky Lviv Natl Med Univ, Dept Internal Med 2, Lvov, Ukraine; [Yessirkepov, Marten] South Kazakhstan Med Acad, Dept Biol & Biochem, Shymkent, Kazakhstan","Gasparyan, AY (corresponding author), Dudley Grp NHS Fdn Trust, Russells Hall Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Pensnett Rd, Dudley DY1 2HQ, W Midlands, England.; Gasparyan, AY (corresponding author), Dudley Grp NHS Fdn Trust, Russells Hall Hosp, Dept Res & Dev, Pensnett Rd, Dudley DY1 2HQ, W Midlands, England.; Gasparyan, AY (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Teaching Trust, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",a.gasparyan@gmail.com,"Gasparyan, Armen Yuri/C-9174-2009; Zimba, Olena/Q-4031-2017","Gasparyan, Armen Yuri/0000-0001-8749-6018; Zimba, Olena/0000-0002-4188-8486; Gupta, Latika/0000-0003-2753-2990",,,"Ahmed S, 2020, INDIAN J RHEUMATOL, DOI [10.4103/injr.injr_15_20., DOI 10.4103/INJR.INJR_15_20]; Bauchner H, 2020, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V323, P1256, DOI 10.1001/jama.2020.3980; Callaway E, 2020, NATURE, V582, P167, DOI 10.1038/d41586-020-01520-4; Eysenbach G, 2004, J MED INTERNET RES, V6, P12, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.3.e34; Fleming N., CORONAVIRUS MISINFOR; Gang L, 2018, P 2 INT C INN ART IN, P163; Gasparyan AY, 2020, J KOREAN MED SCI, V35, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e176; Gasparyan AY, 2019, J KOREAN MED SCI, V34, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e184; Gasparyan AY, 2015, J KOREAN MED SCI, V30, P1545, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2015.30.11.1545; Gasparyan AY, 2015, J KOREAN MED SCI, V30, P360, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2015.30.4.360; Gasparyan AY, 2014, CROAT MED J, V55, P61, DOI 10.3325/cmj.2014.55.61; Gewin Virginia, 2014, Nature, V507, P389; Glasziou PP, 2020, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V369, DOI 10.1136/bmj.m1847; Goel A, 2020, JCR-J CLIN RHEUMATOL, DOI [10.1097/RHU.0000000000001508., DOI 10.1097/RHU.0000000000001508]; Gupta L, ANN RHEUM DIS; Heaven D, 2018, NATURE, V563, P609, DOI 10.1038/d41586-018-07245-9; Kwon Diana, 2020, Nature, V581, P130, DOI 10.1038/d41586-020-01394-6; Ledford H, 2020, NATURE, V582, P160, DOI 10.1038/d41586-020-01695-w; Llewellyn S, 2020, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V368, DOI 10.1136/bmj.m1160; Misra DP, 2020, INDIAN J RHEUMATOL, V15, P3, DOI 10.4103/injr.injr_53_20; Zimba O, 2020, RHEUMATOL INT, V40, P183, DOI 10.1007/s00296-019-04493-4",21,0,0,0,0,KOREAN ACAD MEDICAL SCIENCES,SEOUL,"302 75 DONG DU ICHON, DONG YONGSAN KU, SEOUL 140 031, SOUTH KOREA",1011-8934,1598-6357,,J KOREAN MED SCI,J.

However, an over-optimistic technologisation of neuroscientifically-informed psychiatry risks the conflation of technological and psychological norms. Neurotechnologies promise fast, efficient, broad psychiatric insights not readily available through conventional observation of patients. Recording and processing brain signals provides information from 'beneath the skull' that can be interpreted as an account of neural processing and that can provide a basis to evaluate general behaviour and functioning. But it ought not to be forgotten that the use of such technologies is part of a human practice of neuroscience informed psychiatry. This paper notes some challenges in the integration of neural technologies into psychiatry and suggests vigilance particularly in respect to normative challenges. In this way, psychiatry can avoid a drift toward reductive technological approaches, while nonetheless benefitting from promising advances in neuroscience and technology.","[Rainey, Stephen] Oxford Uehiro Ctr Pract Eth, Suite 8,Littlegate House,St Ebbes St, Oxford OX1 1PT, England; [Erden, Yasemin J.] St Marys Univ, Twickenham, England","Rainey, S (corresponding author), Oxford Uehiro Ctr Pract Eth, Suite 8,Littlegate House,St Ebbes St, Oxford OX1 1PT, England.",stephen.rainey@philosophy.ox.ac.uk,,,"BrainCom Project, Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [732032]","Stephen Rainey gratefully acknowledge funding from the BrainCom Project, Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (732032).","Ashrafian H, 2017, SCI ENG ETHICS, V23, P403, DOI 10.1007/s11948-016-9783-0; Bench-Capon TJM, 2007, ARTIF INTELL, V171, P619, DOI 10.1016/j.artint.2007.05.001; Bzdok D, 2018, BIOL PSYCHIAT-COGN N, V3, P223, DOI 10.1016/j.bpsc.2017.11.007; Chiao JY, 2012, CRITICAL NEUROSCIENCE: A HANDBOOK OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS OF NEUROSCIENCE, P287; Churchland PS, 1989, NEUROPHILOSOPHY UNIF; Cohn S, 2012, CRITICAL NEUROSCIENCE: A HANDBOOK OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS OF NEUROSCIENCE, P179; Dumit J, 2012, CRITICAL NEUROSCIENCE: A HANDBOOK OF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS OF NEUROSCIENCE, P195; Dwyer DB, 2018, ANNU REV CLIN PSYCHO, V14, P91, DOI [10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816045037, 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045037]; Fang JY, 2017, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V13, P723, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S113998; Farahany N.

Even if the proportion eta of available unethical strategies is small, the probability p(U) of picking an unethical strategy can become large; indeed, unless returns are fat-tailed p(U) tends to unity as the strategy space becomes large. We define an unethical odds ratio, Upsilon (capital upsilon), that allows us to calculate p(U) from eta, and we derive a simple formula for the limit of Upsilon as the strategy space becomes large. We discuss the estimation of Upsilon and p(U) in finite cases and how to deal with infinite strategy spaces. We show how the principle can be used to help detect unethical strategies and to estimate eta.

According to many theoreticians and practitioners, the framework of vulnerability allows formulating an alternative language to articulate problems of inequality, power imbalances and social injustice. Building on this conceptualisation, we try to understand the role and potentiality of the notion of vulnerable data subjects. The starting point for this reflection is wide-ranging development, deployment and use of data-driven technologies that may pose substantial risks to human rights, the rule of law and social justice. Implementation of such technologies can lead to discrimination systematic marginalisation of different communities and the exploitation of people in particularly sensitive life situations. Considering those problems, we recognise the special role of personal data protection and call for its vulnerability-aware interpretation. This article makes three contributions. First, we examine how the notion of vulnerability is conceptualised and used in the philosophy, human rights and European law. We then confront those findings with the presence and interpretation of vulnerability in data protection law and discourse. Second, we identify two problematic dichotomies that emerge from the theoretical and practical application of this concept in data protection. Those dichotomies reflect the tensions within the definition and manifestation of vulnerability. To overcome limitations that arose from those two dichotomies we support the idea of layered vulnerability, which seems compatible with the GDPR and the risk-based approach. Finally, we outline how the notion of vulnerability can influence the interpretation of particular provisions in the GDPR. In this process, we focus on issues of consent, Data Protection Impact Assessment, the role of Data Protection Authorities, and the participation of data subjects in the decision making about data processing.

There is a rush to define principles and frameworks for these activities, including the research that underlies innovations. This article illustrates and explores some of the perspectives, proposals, inventories and other materials that comprise these efforts. It begins with a look at the current interest in research ethics, and then highlights and comments on examples of the ethical frameworks, principles, and other schemes that have recently appeared. It then considers impact assessment of various kinds, especially regarding data-driven technologies, in which ethical and social issues or values are to the fore. It ends by touching on some issues that relate to attempts to devise ways of dealing with the adverse effects of advanced technologies and systems, including governance and the making of ethics-based judgments.

From stochastic first order methods, now the focus is shifting to stochastic second order methods due to their faster convergence and availability of computing resources. In this paper, we have proposed a novel stochastic trust region inexact Newton method, called as STRON, to solve large-scale learning problems which uses conjugate gradient to inexactly solve trust region subproblem. The method uses progressive subsampling in the calculation of gradient and Hessian values to take the advantage of both, stochastic and full-batch regimes. We have extended STRON using existing variance reduction techniques to deal with the noisy gradients and using preconditioned conjugate gradient as subproblem solver, and empirically proved that they do not work as expected, for the large-scale learning problems. Finally, our empirical results prove efficacy of the proposed method against existing methods with bench marked datasets.","[Chauhan, Vinod Kumar] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England; [Chauhan, Vinod Kumar; Sharma, Anuj] Panjab Univ, Comp Sci & Applicat, Chandigarh, India; [Dahiya, Kalpana] Panjab Univ, Univ Inst Engn & Technol, Chandigarh, India","Chauhan, VK (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England.; Chauhan, VK (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Comp Sci & Applicat, Chandigarh, India.",vk359@cam.ac.uk; anujs@pu.ac.in; kalpanas@pu.ac.in,"Chauhan, Vinod Kumar/O-5926-2018","Chauhan, Vinod Kumar/0000-0001-8195-548X",,,"Agarwal N, 2017, J MACH LEARN RES, V18; Allen-Zhu Z, 2017, J MACH LEARN RES; Bellavia S, 2018, OPT ONLINE; Berahas A.S., 2016, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, P1055; Bollapragada R, 2018, P 35 INT C MACH LEAR, V80, P620; Bollapragada R, 2016, ARXIV160908502; Boyd S., 2004, CONVEX OPTIMIZATION; Byrd RH, 2016, SIAM J OPTIMIZ, V26, P1008, DOI 10.1137/140954362; Byrd RH, 2011, SIAM J OPTIMIZ, V21, P977, DOI 10.1137/10079923X; Cauchy A.-L., 1847, CR HEBD ACAD SCI, V25, P536, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511702396.063; Chauhan VK, 2019, APPL INTELL, V49, P3331, DOI 10.1007/s10489-019-01450-3; Chauhan VK, 2019, ARTIF INTELL REV, V52, P803, DOI 10.1007/s10462-018-9614-6; Chauhan VK, 2018, APPL INTELL, V48, P4715, DOI 10.1007/s10489-018-1235-x; Chauhan VK, 2017, P 9 AS C MACH LEARN, V77, P49; Chauhan VK, 2019, ARXIV190409448; Csiba D, 2016, IMPORTANCE SAMPLING, P1; Defazio A., 2014, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, P1646; Fan RE, 2008, J MACH LEARN RES, V9, P1871; Fanhua S, 2018, ARXIV180209932; Fletcher R., 1980, PRACTICAL METHODS OP, V1; Hogan E, 2013, 2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS: BIG DATA, EMERGENT THREATS, AND DECISION-MAKING IN SECURITY INFORMATICS, P315, DOI 10.1109/ISI.2013.6578850; Hsia CY, 2018, P 10 AS C MACH LEARN; Hsia CY, 2017, AS C MACH LEARN, V77, P33; Kolte R, 2015, NIPS WORKSH OPT MACH; Le Roux N, 2012, TECH REP; Lin CJ, 2008, J MACH LEARN RES, V9, P627; Lin CJ, 1999, SIAM J OPTIMIZ, V9, P1100, DOI 10.1137/S1052623498345075; LIU DC, 1989, MATH PROGRAM, V45, P503, DOI 10.1007/BF01589116; Lucchi A, 2015, ARXIV150308316; Mokhtari A, 2014, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V62, P6089, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2014.2357775; Moritz P, 2016, AISTATS; Nocedal Wright S, 1999, NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATI; ROBBINS H, 1951, ANN MATH STAT, V22, P400, DOI 10.1214/aoms/1177729586; Schmidt M, 2017, MATH PROGRAM, V162, P83, DOI 10.1007/s10107-016-1030-6; Schraudolph N.

AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interests-and even their own political stability-in the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system. We argue that the prevention of malicious uses of AI and the enhancement of human welfare create strong common interests across jurisdictions that require sustained efforts to develop better, mutually beneficial approaches. We hope that new technology diplomacy will facilitate the dialogues necessary to help all interested parties develop a shared understanding and coordinate efforts to utilise AI for the benefit of humanity, a task whose difficulty should not be underestimated.","[Feijoo, Claudio] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Feijoo, Claudio] Tongji Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Kwon, Youngsun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Bauer, Johannes M.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Bohlin, Erik] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Howell, Bronwyn] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Jain, Rekha] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Potgieter, Petrus] Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa; [Vu, Khuong] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Whalley, Jason] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Xia, Jun] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing, Peoples R China","Feijoo, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",claudio.feijoo@upm.es; yokwon@kaist.ac.kr; bauerj@msu.edu; erik.bohlin@chalmers.se; bronwyn.howell@vuw.ac.nz; rekha@iima.ac.in; php@grensnut.com; vuminhkhuong@nus.edu.sg; jason.whalley@northumbria.ac.uk; xiajun@bupt.edu.cn,"Feijoo, Claudio/AAR-7878-2020; Xia, Jun/AAT-7630-2020","Potgieter, Petrus/0000-0003-1785-761X",,,"[Anonymous], 2018, PEOPLES DAILY; Ansell C, 2008, J PUBL ADM RES THEOR, V18, P543, DOI 10.1093/jopart/mum032; Baccala M., 2018, AI PREDICTIONS 8 INS; BeijingAcademy of Artificial Intelligence, 2019, BEIJ AI PRINC; Beishon M., 2018, INTERMEDIA, V45, P20; Bremmer I.
